\maketitle

The purpose of this chapter is to understand how derivatives and portfolios consisting of financial assets evolve over time. The tools we use here will come from early calculus classes. This comes with the benefit that the concepts are elementary; however, the drawback is that the reader may want to review Taylor's theorem for a full understanding of what is happening. 

The first section deals with how a portfolio changes with respect to changes in the underlying asset's value and changes in time. This is followed with several definitions of our Greek values. These sound fancy, but they are just partial derivatives with respect to a particular variable. Once we have these tools, we will apply Taylor's theorem
