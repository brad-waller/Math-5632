\maketitle

Our last chapter introduced some very interesting relationships between our derivatives, such as put-call parity, asset-or-nothing parity, and bull spreads, for example. The drawback to such an approach is that we were not able to get our hands on the price of a derivative. It is the goal of this chapter and the next to develop models that can be used in such a manner. 

The early sections in this chapter deal with a very simple binomial model where an asset can take two possible prices. This simple model spawns the much more versatile multiperiod binomial models. These models will be seen, and they will be applied to almost every derivative we have seen up to this point in time.
