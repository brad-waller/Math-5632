\maketitle

This chapter is very much disjoint from the rest of the book, and it could very well have been tackled after reading the first chapter. Here we study portfolios and their returns. In particular, we try to develop diversified portfolios. That is the topic of the first section. From there, we develop the concepts of frontier funds and efficient portfolios. 

The efficient portfolios give us the tools necessary to develop the Capital Asset Pricing Model. That will be our goal of this chapter, and once again, we will find ourselves using calculus to solve our problems.
