Welcome to the Math 5632 textbook! This book will assist you in learning many of the concepts related to the Society of Actuaries' exam IFM. In this first chapter, we will discuss many of the fundamentals that you will need as you advance in the course.

We begin with a discussion regarding how to measure growth. This is natural in any study of financial matters. From there, we talk about some of the basics regarding stock purchasing and selling along with some information about dividends. We finish the chapter with concepts related to measuring how well you did in investing along with our first derivatives!
