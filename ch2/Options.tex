\maketitle

We have covered many of our fundamentals in the previous chapter. From this point onwards, we will be very interested in two types of derivatives called options, namely calls and puts. They will be the subject of our first section and much of the book. Later topics in this chapter will cover different approaches on the same kind of concept.

Later in the chapter, we will try to relate these options to other assets. The no arbitrage assumption that we make will allow us to determine the price of a variety of derivatives based off of payoffs. In this chapter, we will use the same assumption to compare financial instruments to exploit arbitrage opportunities. These can be seen in the parity and inequalities sections.
